# Sound-Classificaition

Infinite frequencies and sound waveforms exist everywhere
and it is easily possible to identify every other
feature in a sound wave clearly. Every single feature of a
sound will be exactly distinguished by any normal human
brain. It becomes more intriguing when the same activity
could be performed by any smart device or artificial prediction
models or deep learning models. These feature selections
and identification helps us to interpret every sound form in
and around us in this environment. Other complexities and
challenges arrive when the accuracy level of this artificial
model is expected to mimic as close as to the human level
of identification and classification.

The objective of this study is to experiment with different
neural network models and build different network
methodologies. These models should be capable of extracting
different sound features from sound excerpts or soundtracks
and identify to which class of sound does the audio signals
belong. In this project 4 different deep learning models like
an artificial neural network, Convolutional Neural Network
two dimensional model with ReLu activation, Convolutional
Neural Network two dimensional model with eLu activation,
and Long Short-Term Memory which is used to compare 8
optimizers activation.

Motivation for this experiment or project was inspired due
to several significant applications of sound classifications like:
The use of security systems will help in identifying any
emergency situations like scenarios with broken glass or an
alarm for emergency fire. These classification algorithms take
the main role in recommendation algorithm systems. Whereas,
application in other fields like speech-to-text translations,
language conversions, and human speech classification is also
predominant.

To elaborate the overview flow of this project, initially, the
soundtracks are interpreted differently for feature extraction
according to different deep learning models. Librosa library
is used to extract such sound features from the audio signal
and further, used in the input for deep learning models. These
features are first in the form of
